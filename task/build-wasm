# XXX: the following may be brittle as it depends on emscripten
#      internals.
#
#      observing the output of running emsdk_env.* should indicate
#      which environment variables are expected to have which
#      particular values so if the following breaks, the
#      aforementioned output could be one place to look for clues.
#
# XXX: not sure how to integrate emsdk_env.sh...
#
#      might not be possble because one needs to . or source it?
#
#        https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-make/2006-04/msg00142.html
#
#      the output of sourcing displays which env vars are set and what
#      they are set to.  a hack would be to capture and parse that output?
#      some attempts at this failed -- "source" doesn't work via
#      $(shell ,,,) and "." didn't work out for different reasons
#
#      running EMSDK_QUIET=1 python ~/src/emsdk/emsdk.py construct_env
#      produces output of the form:
#
#        export PATH="...";
#        export EMSDK="...";
#        export EMSDK_NODE="...";
#        unset EMSDK_QUIET;
#
#      possibly that could be parsed...but seems like a lot of work

#      emscripten changes certain things
